Agribot is a voice-first, AI-powered agricultural learning and guidance assistant that helps farmers, agriculture students, and agri‑entrepreneurs with high‑accuracy crop guidance, personalized learning, and disease detection — accessible 24/7 and optimized for low-end devices.

Built for the OpenAI x NxtWave Buildthon — State Level under:
- AI for Everyday India
- AI for Indian Business
- AI for Social Good
- AI for Education

## ✨ Why Agribot?

- Voice-first: hands-free, noise tolerant, multilingual & code-mixed inputs.
- Education + Diagnosis: text/audio/video lessons plus high-accuracy disease detection.
- Offline-capable: caches essential lessons and Q&A for low-connectivity use.
- Personalized: adapts lessons by crop, region, season, soil and history.
- Farmer-friendly: simple language, step-by-step guidance, daily micro-tips.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🎧 Voice Assistant: Natural farmer-language understanding, TTS/SSML-ready responses, dialogue history.
- 📘 Learning Engine: Text lessons, audio lessons, short AI-generated video scripts and quizzes.
- 🧪 Disease Detection: Image preprocessing → multi-stage verification → classifier + severity estimation.
- 📊 Dashboard: Personalized crop reports, progress tracking, recovery history.

## ⚡ Quickstart (developer)

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/agribot.git
2. Configure environment (.env / .env.example):
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - DATABASE_URL / STORAGE_URL
3. Start services:
   - Backend: npm install && npm run dev  OR  pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   - Frontend: npm install && npm start  OR  flutter run
4. (Optional) Start detection service: python inference_service.py

Tip: Add a docker-compose for reproducible local dev and replace placeholder badges with repo-specific URLs.

## 🔬 Disease Detection Pipeline (outline)

1. Preprocess: denoise, resize, segment leaf area  
2. Verify: image quality checks (blur, lighting, occlusion)  
3. Feature extraction: CNN + transfer learning  
4. Classification: disease type + confidence score  
5. Severity: lesion coverage %, health index  
6. Output: treatment steps, preventive measures, follow-up schedule

Include a lightweight quantized model for offline fallback.

---

## 📚 Personalization & Education Engine

- Store per-user context: crops, region, soil, weather, disease history  
- Adaptive learning paths: beginner → intermediate → expert  
- LLM produces farmer-friendly language and local-language translations  
- Generate voice scripts and short video scripts for lessons

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

- Collect only necessary data; encrypt sensitive info at rest and in transit.  
- Provide confidence scores and encourage field visits or expert consults for low-confidence cases.  
- Log anonymized metrics for model improvement.

---

## 🛣 Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- Marketplace for seeds, fertilizers and tools  
- Drone integration for field monitoring  
- Soil test analyzer integration  
- Community learning hub and peer Q&A  
- Government schemes & subsidy alerts
